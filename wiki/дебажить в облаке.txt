enable SSH tunnel both for space and application (cf allow-space-ssh <space name> and cf enable-ssh <app name>). You may also need to restart deployed application.
run the jvmmon for container (cf ssh <app name> -c "app/META-INF/.sap_java_buildpack/sapjvm/bin/jvmmon")
in the opened CLI enter start debugging
(OPTIONAL) print debugging information to verify, then q to exit
open the ssh tunnel cf ssh <app name> -N -T -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000.

enable SSH tunnel both for space and application (cf allow-space-ssh <space name> and cf enable-ssh <app name>). You may also need to restart deployed application.
To open the debugging port, you need to configure the JAVA_OPTS parameter in your JVM. From the cf CLI, execute cf set-env <app name> JAVA_OPTS '-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8000'
open the ssh tunnel cf ssh <app name> -N -T -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000.
